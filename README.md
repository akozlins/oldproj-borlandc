================

I started programming in C and C++ around 1998. Here is small collection
of programs that i wrote around that time.

 - All programs were originally compiled with Borland C compiler.

Structure:
dir/cp.c - copy file (usage: 'cp <src> <dest>')
dir/dirlist.c - print directory structure (usage: 'dirlist <dir>')
