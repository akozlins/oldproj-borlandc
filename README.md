================

I started programming in C and C++ around 1998. Here is a small collection
of programs that i wrote around this time.

If i remember correctly all of the programs were originally compiled with
Borland compiler. Now i dont really have possibility to check if everything
works, so some programms are unusable. Especialy the ones that use DOS
interrupts, such as mouse interrupts. Also i dont remember now what each
program actually doing.

Will add some description in future (when i will remember).
